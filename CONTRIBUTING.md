There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cfpb/qualtrics-template)
to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute.
Find a bug or a feature, mention in the issue that you will take on that effort,
then follow the _Changing the codebase_ guidance below.


## Changing the codebase

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository,
make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request.
Please try to follow the styles and patterns of the existing codebase.
